# Phantom CEP Framework

Phantom is a easy to use CEP framework that enables anyone to quickly setup, build and run a CEP engine.

Phantom is built around [Esper](http://esper.codehaus.org), an OSS Complex Event Processing (CEP) library which enables anyone to build high-throughput, low-latency, real-time event processing applications.

**The code is still undergoing major reorganizations and clean-ups.**
